The researchers also took this one step further by identifying the pathway by which NR prevents nerve damage. They found that NR increases the activity of an NAD+-dependent molecule called sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), which is known to play vital roles in maintaining the function of mitochondriaâ€”the < a href=http://"facebook.com" > sausage-shaped powerhouses of cells.
When they engineered the mice to express high levels of SIRT3, the animals <a href=http://"google.com" > were resistant to noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Furthermore, when they deleted the SIRT3 gene, NR no longer protected the mice from NIHL.
